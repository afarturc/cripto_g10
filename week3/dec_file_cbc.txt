The morning sunlight streamed through the window, painting golden shapes across the wooden floor. Outside, the town was just beginning to wake; the faint hum of cars mixed with the soft chatter of early risers heading to the cafÃ© on the corner. Emma poured herself a cup of coffee and leaned against the counter, savoring the quiet before the day truly began.
She had moved here six months ago, trading the noise and rush of the city for the rhythm of a smaller life. The locals had been kindâ€”curious at first, but kindâ€”and she had found a calm she hadnâ€™t realized she was missing. The bookshop she now owned, nestled between a bakery and a florist, smelled faintly of old paper and cinnamon from next door. It wasnâ€™t much, but it was hers.
Some mornings, she would unlock the door, turn the sign to Open, and wonder what stories would walk in that day. Sometimes it was a child looking for a tale aboutæ›Ô¹%šàKÒˆ„mes a~ old man searching for a poem his late wife once read aloud. Each person left behind a trace of themselves, a shared moment that made the quiet town feel endlessly alive.
That morning, as Emma watched a new customer step hesitantly inside, she smiled. â€œGood morning,â€ she said softly, already reaching for the kettle. â€œYou look like you could use a warm drink and a good story.â€
