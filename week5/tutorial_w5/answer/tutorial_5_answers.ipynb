    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in fact, these PDFs have the exact same hash value for SHA-1 function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get an overview about the **SHA-1 collision attack** paper by the SHAttered group.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in a nutshell, this attack is based on (for 3 colliding messages) to find/generate a difference in the second block pair that cancels out the difference initially caused by the first block. This leads again to identical chaining values and hence a collision.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is employed *differential paths* to describe precisely the differences in state words **and** message words and of how these differences should propagate through the **80 steps** of the **SHA-1 hash function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is done by modifying message words and thus directly influencing the next 16 state words (have in mind that the first 5 states are fixes by the **chaining value**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The key for the solution to this, is the concept of *local collisions*, where any state bit difference introduced is to be canceled in the next 5 steps using correction message bit difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure evetr message word but differences are compatible with the linea message expansion though, it is used a *Disturbance Vector (DV)*, that, to sum it up, it is a correctly expanded message itself, but where every \"1\" bit marks the start of a **local collision**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's utterly important the selection of a good disturbance vector. That's why the main reason of using two blocks pair instead of one, this choice alleviates a restriction of this vector itself which is that there are no state differences after the last step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to Wang et al, this was solved. Crafting the **tailored differential path** that over the first 16 steps connects the input chaining value differences to the local collision differences over the remaining steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it's necessary to choose a good disturbance vector, then for each near-collision attack craft a non-linear differential path, determine a system of equation over all steps and finally find a solution in the form if a near-collision message block pair. Important to know is that one can only craft the non-linear path for the second near-collision attack once the caining values resulting from the first block pair are known."
