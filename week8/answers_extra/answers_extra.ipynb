    "### Vulnerability of the naive RSA signature scheme\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive RSA signature scheme is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sign:** $\\sigma = M^{d} \\mod N$\n",
    "- **Verify:** accept if $M' = \\sigma^{e} \\mod N = M$\n",
    "\n",
    "This scheme is vulnerable to forgery because it is possible to produce valid signatures for certain messages without knowing the private key \\(d\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for trivial messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M = 0$, the signature is $\\sigma = 0^{d} \\mod N = 0$, which is trivial to forge.  \n",
    "- $M = 1$, the signature is $\\sigma = 1^d \\mod N = 1$, also trivial.  \n",
    "- $M = N-1$, the signature is $\\sigma = (N-1)^d \\mod N = N-1$, again easy to produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, due to the mathematical properties of RSA, an attacker can select any arbitrary value $\\sigma \\in [0, N-1]$, then compute the corresponding message $M = \\sigma^e \\mod N$. This pair $(M, \\sigma)$ will pass verification despite the attacker not having access to the private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this naive signature scheme does not provide unforgeability, as an adversary can create valid signature-message pairs without the private key."
