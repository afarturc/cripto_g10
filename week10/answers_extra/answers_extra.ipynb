    "\n",
    "So far, we know that Alice picks the signing key $sk_{A}$ and forms the public verifying key by computing $pk_{A} \\leftarrow sk_{A} \\cdot G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, she picks a random value $k$, and computes the signature $\\sigma \\leftarrow m - k \\cdot sk_{A} \\cdot G$. Sends these informations to Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then Bob checks that $m = \\sigma + k \\cdot pk_{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's then substitute $\\sigma$ for $m - k \\cdot sk_{A} \\cdot G$ in the last equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$m = \\sigma + k \\cdot pk_{A} \\Leftrightarrow m = m - k \\cdot sk_{A} \\cdot G + k \\cdot pk_{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's then substiture $pk_{A}$ with $sk_{A} \\cdot G$\n",
    "\n",
    "$m = m - k \\cdot sk_{A} \\cdot G + k \\cdot sk_{A} \\cdot G \\Leftrightarrow m = m$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows that the verification algorithm works accordingly for correctly signed messages\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Question - P2\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that at this point, we get all the values except for $sk_{A}$. These value are:\n",
    "$p, G, pk_{A}, m, k$ and $\\sigma$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we know that $\\sigma \\leftarrow m - k \\cdot sk_{A} \\cdot G$ and that \n",
    "$pk_{A} \\leftarrow sk_{A} \\cdot G$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by making a substitution in the $\\sigma$ equation we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma \\leftarrow m - k \\cdot pk_{A}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$m$, $k$, and $pk_{A}$ are the message, the random value k picked by Alice and the public key computed by Alice respectively. All of these values are public and can be got by any attacker.\n",
